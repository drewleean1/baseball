Most of the code and logic was based on CS340 Flask Starter Code.

Used much of what we learned in CS290 for the CSS/favicons. 

A lot of the Bootstrap framework (navbar and buttons) was sourced from a Tech With Tim video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&t=369s)
As well as the Bootstrap website (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/).
